# 100 days of code
This is just a collection of miscellaneous small projects for my 100 days of code exercise.

Larger projects may get their own repositories, but there will likely be multiple small
exploratory projects during the period.

### projects included
- simple hotel guest tracking class to practice pytest.  Based on Jason Swett's [Ruby Testing Micro-Course](https://www.codewithjason.com/ruby-testing-micro-course-lesson-1/)
